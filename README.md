# MicroQiskitCpp

This version of MicroQiskit for C++ is currently in development on replit [here](https://repl.it/@quantum_jim/MicroQiskitC) and on a fork linked [here](https://github.com/omarcostahamido/MicroQiskitCpp). 
It currently works, but there are still things to be done.

Please access the main MicroQiskit repository [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit) for more information.
